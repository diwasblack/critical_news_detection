abstract="Novelty search is a recent and promising approach to evolve neurocontrollers, especially to drive robots. The main idea is to maximize the novelty of behaviors instead of the efficiency. However, abandoning the efficiency objective(s) may be too radical in many contexts. In this paper, a Pareto-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithmis employed to reconcile novelty search with objective-based optimization by following a multiobjectivization process. Several multiobjectivizations based on behavioral novelty and on behavioral diversity are compared on a maze navigation task. Results show that the bi-objective variant ``Novelty + Fitness'' is better at fine-tuning behaviors than basic novelty search, while keeping a comparable number of iterations to converge.",

	abstract = {Protein crystallization remains a highly empirical process. The purpose of protein crystallization screening is the determination of the main factors of importance leading to protein crystallization. One of the major problems about determining these factors is that screening is often expanded to many hundreds or thousands of conditions to maximize combinatorial chemical space coverage for a successful (crystalline) outcome. In this paper, we propose a new experimental design method called “Associative Experimental Design (AED)” that provides a list of screening factors that are likely to lead to higher scoring outcomes or crystals by analyzing preliminary experimental results. We have tested AED on Nucleoside diphosphate kinase, HAD superfamily hydrolase, and nucleoside kinase proteins derived from the hyperthermophile Thermococcus thioreducens [1]. After obtaining the candidate novel conditions, we have confirmed that AED method yielded high scoring crystals after experimenting in a wet lab.},
