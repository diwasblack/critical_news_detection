\section{Future Works}
It has been empirically shown that most of the existing NLP system can be improved by using word embedding as extra word feature\cite{turian2010word}. However the extend of improvement that word embedding models could bring about for critical news detection remains to be   seen.\par
Another possibility that could be explored for improving the performance is using sequence analysis algorithms such as HMM\cite{baum1966statistical}, or Recurrent Neural Networks such as LSTM\cite{hochreiter1997long} and GRU\cite{cho2014learning} for class prediction. These algorithms could also be used along with the word embedding models.
