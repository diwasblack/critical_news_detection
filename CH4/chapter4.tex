\section{Dataset}
In order to gain insight into the dataset it is better to first visualize the data. Visualizing high dimensional data requires reducing the dimensions to either 2 or 3. The t-SNE\cite{maaten2008visualizing} is an excellent algorithm which is well suited for such task. The algorithm takes the vectors obtained from the text processing step and produces a 2D vector for each document. The reduced vectors were then plotted using the matplotlib\cite{hunter2007matplotlib} python library. The \figureref{fig:dataset} shows the result of applying t-SNE algorithm on the dataset for critical news.
