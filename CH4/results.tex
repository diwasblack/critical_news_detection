\section{Dataset}
In order to gain insight into the dataset it is better to first visualize the data. Visualizing high dimensional data requires reducing the dimensions to either 2 or 3. The t-SNE\cite{maaten2008visualizing} is an excellent algorithm which is well suited for such task. The algorithm takes the vectors obtained from the text processing step and produces a 2D vector for each document. The reduced vectors were then plotted using the matplotlib\cite{hunter2007matplotlib} python library.

The \figureref{fig:dataset} shows the result of applying t-SNE algorithm on the dataset for critical news. It shows that on average, the feature vectors of critical news are different from the feature vectors of non-critical news which is an excellent outcome. However, the dataset does not have a large margin of separation between the classes and it does look a little bit noisy. The presence of noise and the thin margin of separation could lead to classification errors.

\section{Classification Performance}
The performance of each classifier for five separate runs is shown in \tableref{tbl:critical_news_performance} and the \tableref{tbl:average_performance} shows the average of these runs. It is clear from the tables that on average, the classification models achieve a reasonably high performance which is comparable to one another. It also shows that the average performance of Neural Network model is slightly better than other models.

\tableref{tbl:sample_predictions} shows a sample of prediction done by the best performing model.
