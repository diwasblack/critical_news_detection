\section{Dataset}
In order to gain insight into the dataset, it is better to first visualize the data. Visualizing a high dimensional data requires reducing the number of features to either 2 or 3. The feature reduction could be done by using various dimensionality reduction algorithms \cite{tenenbaum2000global, roweis2000nonlinear} but the t-SNE\cite{maaten2008visualizing} is an algorithm which is well suited for feature reduction for the purpose of data visualization. The algorithm takes the TF-IDF vectors obtained from the text processing step and produces a 2D vector representation for each document. The reduced vectors were then plotted using the matplotlib\cite{hunter2007matplotlib} python library.

The \figureref{fig:dataset} shows the result of applying t-SNE algorithm on the dataset. It shows that on average, the feature vectors of critical news are different from the feature vectors of non-critical news which is a desired outcome. However, the dataset does look a bit noisy and the margin of separation between classes is also a bit thin. Such characteristics of the dataset could introduce errors during classification.

\section{Classification Performance}
The performance of the classifiers for five separate runs on the critical news dataset is shown in \tableref{tbl:critical_news_performance} and the average performance of those runs is shown in \tableref{tbl:average_performance}. The results show that on average, the models achieve a reasonably high performance which are comparable to one another. It also shows that performance of the Neural Network model is sightly better than other models.

The \figureref{fig:dataset} shows that the TF-IDF vector of a critical news is usually different from the TF-IDF vector of non-critical news, so there is a noticeable separation of region in the reduced feature space. The separation is simple enough that a linear decision boundary could correctly classify most of the articles. As the separation of classes is simple in the reduced feature space, it should be the case that the articles should not be too hard to classify in the original high dimensional feature space. The performance of the regularized logistic regression as shown in \tableref{tbl:average_performance} seems to validate this hypothesis.

Since, the logistic regression model was able to achieve a pretty decent performance on the test dataset. It would imply that complex classifier models should at least achieve the same performance achieved by the logistic regression model. But, the problems with the dataset itself would limit the accuracy that can be achieved by the models. That might be the reason behind
barely better performance of complex models.

\tableref{tbl:correct_predictions} shows some of the correctly labelled predictions by the Neural Network model. It shows that the classifier is able to identify the critical news articles when the text clearly contains the important features such as detect, robberi, stab, fatal, etc. In a similar manner, the classifier is able to identify a text as non-critical when the text clearly
does not contain those kind of features.

But the classifier does incorrectly label several text during the testing, some of which are shown in \tableref{tbl:incorrect_predictions}. There might be several reason which could have caused the mislabelling. It might be that the TF-IDF vector representation of the text fails to capture the meaning of the text or it might be simply because of the fact the classifier is not complex enough to make the prediction based on the features used.
