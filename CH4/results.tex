\chapter{Experiments and Results} \label{result}
Once the labelled dataset is ready, the classifier models can be trained on the training set and evaluated using the test set. However, it is better to first visualize the data and then proceed with the training.

1000 dimensional TF-IDF vector can be visualized if the number of features is reduced to 2 or 3. The feature reduction could be done by using various dimensionality reduction algorithms \cite{tenenbaum2000global, roweis2000nonlinear}. The t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)\cite{maaten2008visualizing} is an algorithm  is a feature reduction method suited well for the purpose of data visualization. In this thesis, the algorithm takes the TF-IDF vectors obtained from the text processing step and produces a two dimensional vector representation for each document. The reduced vectors were then plotted using the matplotlib\cite{hunter2007matplotlib} python library.

The dataset visualization indicates that the data does not have significant problems for classification.  Once the classifiers were trained, their performance can be evaluated on the test set.

\section{Dataset Visualization}
\figureref{fig:dataset} shows the result of applying t-SNE algorithm on the dataset. It shows that on average, the feature vectors of significant news are different from the feature vectors of non-significant news which is a desired outcome. However, the dataset does look a bit noisy and the margin of separation between classes is also a bit thin. Such characteristics of the dataset could introduce errors during the classification.

\section{Classification Performance}
The performance of the classifiers for five separate runs on the dataset described in   \tableref{tbl:dataset_statistics} is shown in \tableref{tbl:classifiers_performance} and the average performance of those runs is shown in \tableref{tbl:average_performance}. The results show that on average, the models achieve a reasonably high performance which are comparable to one another; furthermore, it also shows that the neural network model performs slightly better than rest of the models.

As shown in \figureref{fig:dataset}, the feature vectors of significant news are on average different from the feature vectors of non-significant news. So, there is a noticeable separation between the two classes. Many classifier models can benefit from this separation. As the separation is even detectable in a reduced feature space, it should be the case that the news or messages could also be classified by using more than 2 features.  This, indeed, seems to be the reason behind the decent performance of the logistic regression model.

Since the logistic regression model was able to achieve a good performance on the test dataset, it would imply that complex classifier models should at least achieve the same performance as the logistic regression model. %However, the problems with the dataset itself would limit the models from obtaining a significantly better performance than the Logistic Regression model. 
The average performance of the models shown in \tableref{tbl:average_performance} seem to comply with that hypothesis.

Some of the correctly classified messages by the neural network model in the test set are shown in \tableref{tbl:correct_predictions}. It shows that the classifier is able to identify the significant news articles when the text clearly contains important stems such as ``detect", ``robberi", ``stab", ``fatal", etc. Similarly, the classifier is able to identify a non-significant news article when the text clearly lacks those kind of stems.

But the classifier does incorrectly label several texts during the testing, some of which are shown in \tableref{tbl:incorrect_predictions}. The model seems to have a problem of identifying a non-significant news when the text contains stems which are common found in significant news. It could indicate that the TF-IDF vector representation of the text is inadequate to capture the semantics behind it. Similarly, the mislabelling of the significant news articles could have been because of the inability of the classifier to interpret the meaning and implications of the text. One major issue that could lead to incorrect classification is the tokenization. Since tokenization removes numbers from the text, it also eliminates information about date, time and ages. In other words, tokenization loses the temporal context, which could be the reason for the last misclassification example in \tableref{tbl:incorrect_predictions}.

In a similar manner, the class assignment predicted by the neural network model on some recent news  is shown in \tableref{tbl:real_prediction}. The table shows that the model perform fairly good in the recent news articles. The statements which clearly contain important stems like ``beat", ``death", ``shoot", ``police", etc are correctly labelled as significant and articles which clearly do not contain those kinds of features are labelled as non-significant.

\section{Summary}
This chapter analyzes the performance of various classifiers (logistic regression, random forests, SVM, and neural network model) on the significant news dataset. %Even though the dataset was somewhat noisy, the models performed fairly good. 
On average, the models were able to achieve an accuracy greater than 90 percent with neural network model achieving the highest accuracy of 93.654 percent.
