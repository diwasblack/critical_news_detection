%   thesis.tex - UAH Master's Thesis Main TeX file
%
%   This is the main file for my thesis. It loads all content via
%   \include statements

%%% Making the DVI and PDF output the correct size %%%
%   Important - the default pagesize for DVI and PDF output in most LaTeX
%   distributions is a4 (210x297cm, or about 8.27Ã—11.69 in), which won't work
%   for the UAH format.  So, you have to change the DVI and PDF output in your
%   LaTeX distribution.  In most distros, you need to change the following files:

%   (1.)  C:\texmf\dvipdfm\config\dvipdfmx.cfg
%   (2.)  C:\texmf\dvipdfm\config\config
%   (3.)  C:\texmf\pdftex\config\pdftex.cfg

%   For numbers (1.) and (2.), you will change where the files say "p a4" to
%   "p letter" (there should be some explanation in the files themselves, too).
%   For number (3.), you will change two lines of that file to read:

%   page_height 11 true in
%   page_width 8.5 true in

%   There are "model-thesislocal" versions of all the above files in this complete rar
%   package which 'should' override the a4 defaults - but these do not work in
%   some distributions, so editing the above files is usually necessary.
%   For more info, search google for "pdftex.cfg" and "dvipdfmx.cfg"
%%% (End DVI and PDF changes) %%%

%   Define the document class. The proper class is "book." The normal options
%   are "12pt" and "onesided". When printing out copies for purposes other than
%   submission to the Graduate School, the option "twoside" can be used to
%   format the output in a manner which looks good when printed duplex.

\documentclass[12pt,oneside,letterpaper]{book}
%\documentclass[12pt,twoside,letterpaper]{book}

%   Load the packages necessary for the thesis. The only required packages are
%   "uahdis", which loads the UAH Dissertation Style, and "chngpage" which is
%   used by "uahdis". The other packages are optional, and should be loaded only
%   if you have a need for the functionality they provide. Documentation on each is
%   available at CTAN.org. The basic purpose of each are described below:
%   units---provides a convenient mechanism for writing quantities with units.
%   bm---provides a convenient mechanism for producing bold symbols in math mode
%   hhline---improved lines and borders in tables
%   rotating---allows landscape oriented pages in a portrait oriented document
%   verbatim---prints text files verbatim. useful for computer code
%   amsfonts---provides additional typefaces
%   amssymb---provides additional mathematical symbols
%   xspace---properly adjusts space after \newcommands which expand to text
%   booktabs---creates traditional scientific tables - no vertical lines, very
%   few horizontal lines, with varying thickness (not meant to be used with hline)

%   Excellent descriptions of all LaTeX packages can be found here:
%   http://www.tug.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/index.html

%   The next line requires the leading "%". It is only useful if you are using
%   WinEdt as your text editor. It allows WinEdt to collect bibliographic entries into
%   a pop-up table that you can summon when you are \cite-ing a source.

%   LaTeX will look for your chapter files in the appropriate folders,

%   same name as the name you give it below - i.e., for the CH1 folder,
%   LaTeX will look for introduction.tex (which is where you will type
%   all your chapter 1 stuff).  You can name your chapters/files whatever
%   you want - just make sure the names below match the names in the
%   folders.  Also, you can add or subtract chapters as you like -
%   just make sure that the address and filenames below match your
%   file structure.

 \include{./CH2/chapter2}
 \include{./CH3/chapter3}
 \include{./CH4/chapter4}
 \include{./CH5/chapter5}

%   This set of LaTeX files uses the Appendix Package to handle
%   the appendices - it creates the "Appendices" page and puts
%   "Appendix A:" in the TOC.  So, strictly speaking, the
%   \appendix command is not necessary (because the appendix
%   package uses an "appendices environment").  But, for
%   the typedref package to operate correctly, you must include the
%   \appendix command - so, it's included after the beginning of
%   the appendices environment.  If you only have one appendix,
%   then you need to remove the "page" option from the uahdis.sty
%   file ('page' option occurs when loading appendix package).
%   You can add or subtract appendices - they are treated just like
%   chapters - the only difference is that they occur within the
%   appendices environment, which tells LaTeX to give them letters
%   instead of numbers.
