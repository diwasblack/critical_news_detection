\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would be remiss if I failed to express my deepest gratitude to Dr. Ramazan Aygun, who took the time to provide constant suggestions and invaluable insights, without which this thesis would not have been possible.

Also, I would also like extend my thanks to my family and friends who supported me in my endeavors.
