This thesis shows that it is possible to automatically categorize news into two groups; news that are somewhat important and needs verification, and other news that does not matter even if they are fake. The performance of multiple classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forests, and Neural Network on the test data showed that is possible to achieve high accuracy in the task. The Neural Network was the best performing model with a test accuracy of $93.654\%$.
